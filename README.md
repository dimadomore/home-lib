# Digital home library application

### Launch instructions

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Public [link](https://home-lib.now.sh/) to the application

### Technoligies

- `react`
- `next.js`
- `tailwind.css` (Wanted finally to try it and actually enjoyed a lot)

### Some details

- App is using 3-rd party api (Google Api) for fetching books. Google has no categories api, so they are hardcoded. One of the hardcoded category is 'Social Science / General'. The book of this category can be found by typing in search input 'fan'
- Implemented responsive design
- Implemented theming (day mode / night mode)
- Data is persisted
- Added autofocus and debounce for search input
- Forms are validated
- There are no prop types in the app (used to use TypeScript for types)
- The goal was to use the simplest technologies (no big UI-library, React Context for state management, custom hooks)
- 5 cups of coffee drunk

**Thanks for watching!**
